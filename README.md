## Battleship Game (Terminal)
This is a simple Battleship game implemented using Java OOP principles, where the game can be played entirely in the terminal.

### About
This project was created as one of my first Java OOP projects, with the goal of implementing a fun and interactive game that could be played in the terminal. The game follows standard Battleship rules and features multiple classes and methods to provide a modular and organized implementation.

### How to Play
To play the game, simply run the program in the terminal and follow the instructions provided. You will be prompted to place your ships on the game board and take turns firing shots at your opponent. The game will continue until one player has sunk all of their opponent's ships.

### Feedback
I hope you enjoy playing the game! If you have any feedback or suggestions for improvement, please feel free to share them with me.
